### Quick Start

To download the entire dataset to your current directory via the command line, run the following:
```
aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ . --recursive --request-payer
```

Your AWS profile will be charged around $10.

### Data Format

The data is broken up into years from 2017 to 2020. Each 

### Download Instructions

Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

Configure your default AWS profile. If you wish to use the non-default, add the "--profile YOUR_PROFILE" option to all of the following aws commands.

View all files within the S3 bucket containing the dataset using the following command:
```
aws s3 ls s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ --request-payer
```

aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/osm_categories_v10.json . --request-payer
