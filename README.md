## OpenSentinelMap

The OpenSentinelMap dataset contains Sentinel-2 imagery and per-pixel OpenStreetMap label masks. It is described in [this paper](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=todo).

### Quick Start

[SharePoint link](https://vsi.sharepoint.us/:f:/r/sites/PublicShare/Shared%20Documents/vsi-open-sentinel-map?csf=1&web=1&e=od0eHA)

Or use the following command to download from AWS S3.
```
aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ ./open-sentinel-map --recursive --request-payer
```

The dataset is about 445 GB in total. Amazon will charge your AWS profile about $40 (at 9 cents a GB) in data transfer fees.

### Data Format

The data is broken up into years from 2017 to 2020. Each year's worth of Sentinel imagery is compressed into a osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz file. These files can be untarred using the following command.
```
tar -xvzf osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz
```
The untarred folders of sentinel imagery will have the format
```
MGRS_TILE/
    SPATIAL_CELL/
        {ID}_{YEAR}.npz
```
where each .npz file is a compressed numpy file containing the 32-bit float Bottom-of-Atmosphere imagery data. The bands are grouped by resolution, and accessible using the key gsd_{RESOLUTION} (i.e. "gsd_10", "gsd_20", "gsd_60").

The "gsd_10" array bands have the order blue, green, red, and then NIR. The "gsd_20" bands have 4 vegetation red edge bands, followed by two SWIR bands. The "gsd_60" array consists of the coastal aerosol and water vapour bands. The exact corresponding bands from the Sentinel-2 platform are listed in the below table. Find more information about these spectral bands [here](https://gisgeography.com/sentinel-2-bands-combinations/).

| Data Key | Sentinel-2 Bands |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| gsd_10   | B02, B03, B04, B08 |
| gsd_20   | B05, B06, B07, B8A, B11, B12 |
| gsd_60   | B01, B09 |

### Download Instructions

Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

Configure your default AWS profile. If you wish to use the non-default, add the "--profile YOUR_PROFILE" option to all of the following aws commands.

View all files within the S3 bucket containing the dataset using the following command:
```
aws s3 ls s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ --request-payer
```

aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/osm_categories_v10.json . --request-payer
