## OpenSentinelMap

The OpenSentinelMap dataset contains Sentinel-2 imagery and per-pixel OpenStreetMap label masks. It is described in [this paper](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=todo).

### Data Access

The dataset may be freely downloaded from [SharePoint](https://vsi.sharepoint.us/:f:/s/PublicShare/EnWfIp2gvi1As4tTZPzg1RcBYjtczFII9oWkU3MlbMDF9A).

As a backup option, or for faster download speeds, the dataset is also available on Amazon S3. You can use the following command to download it, but beware that Amazon will charge your AWS profile about $40 in data transfer fees (about 9 cents a GB for 445 GB in total).

```
aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ ./open-sentinel-map --recursive --request-payer
```

### Data Format

The data is broken up into years from 2017 to 2020. Each year's worth of Sentinel imagery is compressed into a osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz file. These files can be untarred using the following command.
```
tar -xvzf osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz
```
The untarred folders of sentinel imagery will have the format
```
MGRS_TILE/
    SPATIAL_CELL/
        {ID}_{YEAR}.npz
```
where each .npz file is a compressed numpy file containing the 32-bit float Bottom-of-Atmosphere imagery data. The bands are grouped by spatial resolution, and accessible using the key "gsd_{RESOLUTION}" (i.e. "gsd_10", "gsd_20", "gsd_60").

The "gsd_10" array bands have the order blue, green, red, and then NIR. The "gsd_20" bands have 4 vegetation red edge bands, followed by two SWIR bands. The "gsd_60" array consists of the coastal aerosol and water vapour bands. The exact corresponding bands from the Sentinel-2 platform are listed in the below table. Find more information about these spectral bands [here](https://gisgeography.com/sentinel-2-bands-combinations/).

| Data Key | Sentinel-2 Bands |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| gsd_10   | B02, B03, B04, B08 |
| gsd_20   | B05, B06, B07, B8A, B11, B12 |
| gsd_60   | B01, B09 |
