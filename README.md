## OpenSentinelMap

The OpenSentinelMap dataset contains Sentinel-2 imagery and per-pixel OpenStreetMap label masks. It is described in [this paper](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=todo).

![this is an overview image](/img/dataset_teaser.png)

### Quick Start

To download the entire dataset to your current directory via the command line, run the following:
```
aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ . --recursive --request-payer
```

Amazon will charge your AWS profile around $10 in data transfer fees.

### Data Format

The data is broken up into years from 2017 to 2020. Each year's worth of Sentinel imagery is compressed into a osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz file. These files can be untarred using the following command.
```
tar -xvzf osm_sentinel_imagery_{YEAR}.tgz
```
The untarred folders of sentinel imagery will have the format
```
MGRS_TILE/
    SPATIAL_CELL/
        {ID}_{YEAR}.npz
```
where each .npz file is a compressed numpy file containing the 32-bit float Bottom-of-Atmosphere imagery data. The bands are grouped by resolution, and accessible using the key gsd_{RESOLUTION} (i.e. "gsd_10", "gsd_20", "gsd_60").

### Download Instructions

Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed.

Configure your default AWS profile. If you wish to use the non-default, add the "--profile YOUR_PROFILE" option to all of the following aws commands.

View all files within the S3 bucket containing the dataset using the following command:
```
aws s3 ls s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/ --request-payer
```

aws s3 cp s3://vsi-open-sentinel-map/osm_categories_v10.json . --request-payer
